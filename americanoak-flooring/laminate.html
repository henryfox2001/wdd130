                <strong>Laminate</strong><br>This option is not real wood, and is made out of Formica with a wood pattern. A laminate floor simulates real wood. This product is easier to maintain and install, as opposed 
                to a traditional hardwood floor. A common advantage of a laminate floor is that it may be a more cost-effective solution to a growing problem in your home or business.
