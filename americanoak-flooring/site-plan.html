        <strong>Flooring Categories:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Solid Wood:</strong> The typical hardwood floor can be purchased unfinished or prefinished, and is available in many different species of wood in a variety of grades and colors.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineered Wood:</strong>  This product is a multi-layered wood floor that is usually thinner than solid wood, where the upper layer is the real wood. An engineered wood floor is a very good choice for areas with moisture due to its flexibility and is a great option when installed on top of concrete.</li>
          <li><strong>Laminate Flooring:</strong> This option is not real wood, and is made out of Formica with a wood pattern. A laminate floor simulates real wood. This product is easier to maintain and install, as opposed to a traditional hardwood floor. A common advantage of a laminate floor is that it may be a more cost-effective solution to a growing problem in your home or business.</li>
          <li><strong>Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP):</strong> As the name implies, Luxury Vinyl Planks look like plank of hardwood floors. They are individual pieces of vinyl (not sheet of vinyl), so they look very similar to the real thing. It provides an attractive and durable option for high-traffic areas. The moisture-resistant product offers locking installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Sanding & Refinishing</strong><br>Having your hardwood floors refinished is one of the easiest way to drastically improve the look of your home. There isn’t and easier way to not only improve the beauty of your home but also preserve its value. Here are a few of the most common reasons why customers decide to have their floors refinished:
        <ul>
          <li>Floors are completely worn and have deep scratches,</li>
          <li>Decide to remove carpet of linoleum and refinish the hardwood floors underneath,</li>
          <li>Want to change the color of the hardwood floors.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Phase 1: Sanding</strong><br>
        The first step will be sanding. We will remove old stains, dirt and scratches from the current floor. This will prepare your old wood floor for staining and refinishing. Once we complete the sanding process, we will apply the stain color that you previously selected. <br><br>
        <strong>Phase 2: Sanding</strong><br>
        The finishing process begins by protecting you newly-sanded woof floor with layers of either and oil-based polyurethane finish, a water-based finish, or Rubio Monocoat*. We will discuss all of your options with you, and find the right finish that will make your floor look fantastic for year to come! <br>
        * Rubio Monocoat is a penetration sealer with zero shine whatsoever. It is a revolutionary plant-based, hard-wax oil that is 0% VOC. As the name implies, in 1 coat you’ll get color and protection for your wood. This result in a durable, water-resistant finish, all while keeping the natural look and feel of the wood. <br><br>
        <strong>Buffer</strong><br>
        Your hardwood floors are a highly visible aspect of the design of your home, office, or workplace. Left untreated; scratches, moisture, and dents can not only diminish the natural beauty of your floors but also damage the wood. Regular preventive maintenance is essential to protect your investment and keep your floors looking their best. <br>
        We always use the highest quality materials and follow up with high-speed buffing machines to protect your floor’s finish as well as to bring forth its natural beautiful shine. <br><br>

        <strong>The Importance of Buffing Hardwood Floor</strong> <br>
        It offers numerous benefits to sustain the look you love and restore that brand new fell to your floor. <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Can be an affordable alternative to complete the refinishing process, depending on the condition of your floors and your budget requirements,</li>
          <li>Can hide or reduce any visible scratches and marks,</li>
          <li>Can help protect your floors from future damage,</li>
          <li>Can restore that shiny, new look to your floors,</li>
          <li>Is quick and efficient,</li>
          <li>Is less invasive than a full restoration,</li>
          <li>Leaves little mess and the cleanup is easier than ever.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>The Process:</strong> <br>
        At American Oak Flooring, Inc., we typically offer wood floor buffing as part of our wood floor service for those on a budget or with minor damage. Wood floor buffing can be integral to maintaining your flooring on its own. The process typically consists of the following steps: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Fist, the furniture needs to be relocated.</li>
          <li>Finally, we will buff your hardwood floors to restore shine and reduce any visibility from scratches!</li>
        </ul>
