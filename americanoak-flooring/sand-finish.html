                <strong>Phase 1: Sanding</strong><br>The first step will be sanding. We will remove old stains, dirt and scratches from the current floor. This will prepare your old wood floor for staining and refinishing. 
                Once we complete the sanding process, we will apply the stain color that you previously selected.
