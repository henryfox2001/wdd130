                                            to a traditional hardwood floor. A common advantage of a laminate floor is that it may be a more cost-effective solution to a growing problem in your home or business.

                                            Having your hardwood floors refinished is one of the easiest way to drastically improve the look of your home. There isn’t and easier way to not only improve the beauty 
                                            of your home but also preserve its value. Here are a few of the most common reasons why customers decide to have their floors refinished: • Floors are completely worn and have deep scratches,

                                            The first step will be sanding. We will remove old stains, dirt and scratches from the current floor. This will prepare your old wood floor for staining and refinishing. 
                                            Once we complete the sanding process, we will apply the stain color that you previously selected.

                                            <strong>Phase 2: Finishing</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="p1">
                                        The finishing process begins by protecting you newly-sanded woof floor with layers of either and oil-based polyurethane finish, a water-based finish, or Rubio Monocoat*. 
                                            We will discuss all of your options with you, and find the right finish that will make your floor look fantastic for year to come!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>* Rubio Monocoat is a penetration sealer with zero shine whatsoever. It is a revolutionary plant-based, hard-wax oil that is 0% VOC. As the name implies, in 1 coat you’ll get color and protection for your wood. 
                                            This result in a durable, water-resistant finish, all while keeping the natural look and feel of the wood.
